# ListDailies

Records each daily encountered in an account-wide database. Expires
those that were seen before the last daily reset.

Visiting a daily quest-giver will record his available quests and also
send your current list of available dailies to anyone in your guild
that uses this addon. This includes quests for other realms and quests
you received from other guild members.

Entering the slash command /dailies will report all quest names seen
on the current realm and its connected realms, grouped by zone. (Only
US connected realms are known.)
